# Enhanced-YOLOv8-Object-Detection-and-U-Net
This project implements and compares two powerful deep learning architectures for waste detection and segmentation using the TACO (Trash Annotations in Context) dataset. The goal is to accurately identify and segment litter in images to aid in automated waste management systems.
